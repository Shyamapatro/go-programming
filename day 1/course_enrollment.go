// Scenario: Online Course Enrollment

// Suppose you are developing a system for online course enrollment. Students can enroll in courses based on their eligibility and the availability of seats. The eligibility criteria and enrollment process are as follows:

// To enroll in a course, a student must be at least 16 years old.
// If a course has available seats, any eligible student can enroll.
// If a course is full, only students who are on the waiting list can enroll if they meet the eligibility criteria.
